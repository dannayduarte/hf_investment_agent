# Stock Chat Agent

A conversational AI agent that answers questions about any stock ticker using real-time data from Yahoo Finance and a large language model (LLM) from Hugging Face. The agent loads the latest stock data, summarizes it, and allows users to ask questions in natural languageâ€”just like ChatGPT, but for stocks!

## Features
- Fetches real-time stock data for any ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA)
- Conversational interface powered by a Hugging Face LLM
- Users can change the stock ticker at any time by typing `/ticker SYMBOL` in the chat
- Runs locally or can be deployed publicly (e.g., Hugging Face Spaces)

## Example Use Cases
- "What was the highest closing price for TSLA this week?"
- "Did Apple stock go up or down?"
- "What is the average trading volume for MSFT?"
- "Switch to Google stock" (type `/ticker GOOGL`)
